#  Stochastic Optimization for Recommendation Models

##  Project Description

This project compares several stochastic optimizers for training recommendation models. We apply **Adagrad**, **Adam**, **FTRL**, and **SGD** to recommendation systems based on **Matrix Factorization (MF)** and **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** using the **MovieLens 100k** dataset.

The goal is to evaluate the efficiency of each optimizer based on the following criteria: **prediction accuracy** (measured by RMSE and MAE), **training time**, and **scalability**.

##  Project Objectives

- **Optimizer Evaluation**: Compare Adagrad, Adam, FTRL, and SGD on recommendation tasks.
- **Methodology**: Implement both Matrix Factorization and Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF).
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: RMSE, MAE  
  - Training time  
  - Scalability

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used

We use the **MovieLens 100k** dataset: a collection of 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies.

- `u.data` : User ratings (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp)
- `u.item` : Movie metadata (title, genres, release year)
- `u.user` : User demographics (age, gender, occupation, zip code)
